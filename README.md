This assignment is related to SOLID Principles.
We fetch the file from '(https://github.com/kshitijmishra23/low-level-design-concepts/blob/master/src/oops/SOLID/singleResponsibilityPrinciple/before/Employee.java)' in our vs code.
Also, we convert Java files into C++ files using 'codeconvert AI' and we implement code in the Single Responsibility principle and Dependency inversion principle.
Then use the 'codeconvert AI' to convert in Java file.
